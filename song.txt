I believe what I say
Why does everyone hear me wrong?
If I told you different, would it sound the same?
Would it make a difference in anyway? Oh, no
I know I done wrong, I'll pay for it
It's your turn to talk, for once I'm listenin'



Look at all this heartache, what is left?
Forgetting how it started, this is how it ends, oh no
I know I've done some wrong, I'll pay for it
But it's your turn to talk, for once I'm listening
